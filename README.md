*Just a parser… in reverse.*

---

## What is Resrap?

Resrap is a **seedable, grammar-based code snippet generator**. Instead of parsing code, it **generates code** from formal grammars — producing endless, realistic-looking (or hilariously nonsensical) snippets.

It works with **any language** that can be described with a grammar (even English if you like!) and is perfect for:

* Typing practice with realistic-looking snippets
* Stress-testing parsers, syntax highlighters, or linters
* Fun exploration of procedural code generation

Resrap now also supports **probabilistic and infinitely repeatable grammars** via the **ABNF (Awesome BNF) format** — see `docs/ABNF.md` for full reference.

---

## How?

Resrap reads a grammar and builds a **graph of expansions**. It then randomly traverses the graph (or deterministically with a seed) to produce snippets that:

* Follow the grammar’s syntax rules
* Look structurally like real code
* Include probabilities for weighted choices (`<0.2>`)
* Support infinite loops via the `^` operator

**Example grammar snippet (simplified C):**

```abnf
program : (header+<0.4>) function^;
header:'#include<'identifier'.h>\n';
function:functionheader'{''\n'functioncontent'}';
functionheader:datatype ' ' identifier '(' ')' ;
...
...
````

## Generated code example

```c
#include<success.h>
#include<email.h>
double class(){
while(variable < query && password < variable){
int result = variable + (user / hello);
}
}double user(){
if(class > user && result < class){
float password = 1024.13 - (13.7);
}
}double hello(
```

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/ItsArnavSh/Resrap@v0.1.0
```

---

## Usage

```golang

	//Resrap with Single threaded
	rs := resrap.NewResrap()
	err := rs.ParseGrammarFile("C", "example/C.g4")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	code := rs.GenerateRandom("C", "program", 10)
	fmt.Println(code)

	//Lets get a multithreaded API set up quick
	r := resrap.NewResrapMT(20, 1000) //20 worker pool and 1000 wait queue max size
	err = r.ParseGrammarFile("C", "example/C.g4")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	//Receive from this
	r.StartResrap()
	defer r.ShutDownResrap()
	codeChan := r.GetCodeChannel()
	id := "12321"
	r.GenerateRandom(id, "C", "program", 10)
	res := <-codeChan
	fmt.Println(res.Code)
```

### Notes

* **IDs:** You must create unique IDs for each job; results are returned with the ID.
* **CodeChannel:** A **blocking, unbounded channel** — handle results yourself.
* **Why multithreaded?** Efficiently handles **many concurrent jobs**, fully utilizing CPU cores while keeping grammar graphs immutable and lock-free.

## Roadmap

* Maintain generation sessions (e.g., generate snippets in chunks)
* Dynamic worker scaling and idle worker shutdown

---

## Motivation

Resrap was created to:

* Generate **unlimited, realistic code snippets**
* Avoid copyright issues from using real code
* Provide a **fun, deterministic, and probabilistic code generator**
* Give programmers a playground for **syntax, speed, and randomness**

“Just a parser… in reverse.”

## ABNF (Awesome BNF)

* `^` → Infinite generation (loops nodes without halting)
* `<prob>` → Weighted probabilities for branching
* Compatible with standard EBNF operators: `+`, `*`, `?`, `()`

See [docs/ABNF.md](docs/ABNF.md) for full syntax and examples.
